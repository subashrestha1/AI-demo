Things to do today for the group project:
Progress Report (15% points) (4 pages Max) â€“ Due: 4/12
Propose a model and an algorithm for solving the problem. Describe in detail the model and the algorithm. Demonstrate the success or failure of your approach with a concrete example. Add a detailed description of how the different methods apply to solve the problem (what are the variables, factors, states, etc.). You should describe all the tools HW and SW used in your approach. You should also have finished implementing a preliminary version of your algorithm (maybe it is not fully optimized yet, and it does not have all the features you want). Report your initial experimental results.
